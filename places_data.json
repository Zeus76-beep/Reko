Bringing a measuring tape with you is a good idea anyways to doublecheck they what you need anywhere."

Among other things, I’ve ordered 14 plasterboards of the 1200x2500 size to be delivered home. A few days before the planned delivery, I got notified that those plasterboards were out of stock, despite a much bigger quantity being available in the system when I placed the order. That was annoying enough, as I specifically chose to have home delivery, so I wouldn’t have to rent a trailer and deal with it myself. Other things that I ordered didn’t have the right quantity and were damaged during transport. Luckily, that issue was promptly dealt with. However, it is 3 weeks after I got the notification about the 14 plasterboards being out of stock (2 weeks after the delivery) and I still haven’t received my money back! This is absolutely unacceptable. Complete disorganisation and lack of respect for the customers. Do not shop in Byggmax!"

Would like to benefit businesses in the municipality, but in this case you get better service on e.g. large chains such as in Arninge. Shame, would be happy to pay extra to get good service locally.

Daniel Qviberg really does a great job as project manager at the company. He is responsive and has a good ability to both listen to requests and come up with suggestions on how he thinks we can achieve the best results in terms of budget. The carpenter Kenneth has worked there all 10 years and is great to have with us.\n\nQviberg Bygg is not the cheapest, which is not their ambition either. However, they are professionals, show up on time, do what they have to do and tune in, ask questions and come up with suggestions for solutions when needed.\n\nI recommend them for both large and small projects. We have hired them for the complete renovation of an apartment, stairwell carpentry, site-built carpentry, carpentry of a contemporary chest panel, tiling in the hall, as well as ordinary interior carpentry. Rigging and construction of roofs and walls etc. The company really shines when it comes to fine joinery and finishes. The carpenters have been super professional throughout, but radiated genuine job satisfaction during these fine carpentry works."

Now temporarily fixed, the machine can be used and a spare part ordered. Very pleased!!!"

They forgot to remove the transit bolts from the machine (see picture) or did it on purpose and did not inform me about it. These bolts are used to stop the drum unit inside from moving during transportation. A professional should know about this...\n\nWhen I switched on the machine, the strong vibrations broke the support they had built to fit the machine in the kitchen cabinet, that was not good in the first place.\n\nI then had to disconnect the pipes, remove the machine from the cabinet, open it up, remove the transit bolts, build a better support and put everything back in place. Luckily my dad was around to help.\n\nWhen I complained about the quality of the work done I received no answer. Then, almost two months after, I received an invoice for more than 5.000 SEK. I questioned the amount and their answer was that the only thing they had to take care of was the water connection. This is a lie, I asked them to take care of everything needed to fit the washing machine in the kitchen. In any case, since they did more than just connecting the water pipes, they should be accountable for the way this was done.\n\nBottom line: worst customer service ever and dangerous way of working. If I hadn't realised those bolts were still in place, I would have damaged the machine and the kitchen furniture.\n\nI know finding someone to help with handy work in Stockholm is hard but my strong suggestion is to look elsewhere."

She did not provide our table with glasses while all the other tables had one.\n\nI ordered pad Thai with an extra fried egg on top. My food did not come with the extra egg and she refused to take it off the bill.

So far I’ve liked the place since they have quite democratic pricing. I’d only consider it for food to go, since the place is super small, no WC, and it’s super cold (unless it’s summer). However, today much changed for me since I faced quite a disrespectful situation. It was my first time coming for lunch (which is cheaper than usual), and what I got was obviously a much smaller portion, which they tried to hide (!) by putting 3 big pieces of lemon to fill the space in the box (they normally put one, and the portion fills the whole box). Thus, this “lunch offer” was just a lie. This is not a big deal in terms of money, but a big deal when it comes to how they treat customers."

The hot n spicy is also perfect. But the three things that scores big time are the things that we like the most.\n\n1. Speed! You get your food in a jiffy no matter the que or order!\n\n2. Size! As a grown man you can EASILY! split the lunch with someone or save for the next day. You wont go hungry to the desk. You will sleep on the keyboard...AGAIN!\n\n3. Price! The price is a s we speak 87kr! For a mega portion. And if you are a student its like 55kr(!)\n\nI really recommend this place. Its forth the walk .Try it!! 🍜"

Plenty of fresh lime wedges in the som tam.\nThe rice was bad.  Overcooked and mushy.\n\nToo bad the staff hadn't cleaned the table after previous guests (rice on the tablecloth) and for some reason they cranked up the stereo an hour before closing time when guests were still eating and trying to have conversations.\n\nI won't be back."

Supervisor Lisa is a real professional with a focus on service. She allocated extra painters to our home when the carpet company had to come early to put in carpeting. It managed to deliver an amazing result in record time and they cleaned up so thoroughly it felt like they weren't there. It is clear that Vi Målar Sverige aims to maintain as high a standard as possible on all its jobs. We are so pleased we can be with a painting company and can warmly recommend Vi Målar Sverige AB."

In our appartment they filled (large!) holes in walls, they plastered all walls and ceilings, sanded and painted all walls and ceilings, painted all woodwork and radiators and put up new wallpaper. They work fast, with great attention to detail and with high quality. In short, I can highly recommend them and would 100% ask them again for any paint work."

We got the vegan dumpling basket and the only vegetarian ramen option. We couldn’t finish the food for 2 reasons:\n\n1. The quality of the food was low: the dumplings were dry/undercooked and tasted weird. I don’t know if this was a bad batch or something but paying this much for mediocre/bad food is not worth it. The ramen also tasted very odd, the soy being dry once again.\n\n2. The allergen information is very unclear and the default seems to be egg noodles. Unfortunately I am allergic to egg so when ordering the ramen I didn’t realise since I (maybe falsely) assumed that the only vegetarian dish would also be vegan. This can be a serious risk for some people and there needs to be better information available about allergens when ordering!! Honestly the name of the dish was also misleading (Began) because it’s so close to the word vegan.\n\nWill not be going again !!!!"

It's really a locals place, I think, in a residential neighborhood which is very pleasant but probably not somewhere you'd walk into looking for a restaurant if you didn't know it was there. As soon as we arrived, the staff were friendly and helpful and just generally cool, solicitous without being obsequious — well it was one bloke, really. And the food was terrific, up the traditional Swedish end of the spectrum, very tasty, and generous portions. The whole vibe was just very relaxed: families, older couples, one or two people just there for a drink, a lovely, friendly, inclusive atmosphere altogether. I would definitely go back. The chef came out to shake our hands when we left! He was doing that for a lot of people, how lovely is that?"

The prices are as good as they could get, food is insanely delicious. We all bought the buffet and ate fallafels with rice and creamed spinnach. There is like 10 dishes you can choose in buffet, but you can buy them all seperately, not buying the buffet, even though, I found it most worthy. And the best things is, that ir you buy buffet, you can eat as much as you want. If you are especially vegan or gluten allergic,  I can definetly say that this cozy little place is worth it."

There is not a bad seat in the house! I recommend you sit inside to get the full jail cell vibe! The host at the front was a bit rude and the waitress never came back to give us our check so we finally got up to go pay(unsure if this is normal there). The pasta needed a bit salt and pepper but I would say it’s the spot for the meatballs! I think they should add plaques about the history too!"

The setting was very nice and the food was equally enjoyable. I got the Toast Skagen for the starter, followed by traditional Swedish meatballs which are great if you take a single forkful of meatball, mashed potato, lingonberry, and pickled cucumber together for a delicious flavor profile. For dessert I elected for the Princess Cake which was so dense and moist and had great layers. I highly recommend checking out this hidden restaurant in Gamla Stan for its unique theme as well as its great food."

The design of the place however is nice.\n\nThe food was good, I was really happy about my sushi. The fish, vegetables and rice were really nice, but the seaweed inside was too chewy which took down the overall experience of the food.\nThe bento was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThe service was lovely! The staff was really friendly, respectful and nice.\n\nOne of the downsides for me was also the bathroom. There was no hook to hang your coat/bag on and there was no paper towels in the machine. Did not seem like they regularly made sure it was clean/up to shape, which is a minus on my list.\n\nI can see myself going here again and hope that my minus points was just a one-off. The staff really made a big difference in the overall experience!"

The rolls can be ordered in halves (5 pcs) which was great.  Seaweed salad was super fresh and well seasoned. Green tea in a proper pot was a nice pairing to the food.\nThe ambiance is casual but cute, especially in the back area. The place filled quickly after 7pm on Saturday so reservation is recommended."

People working there are very polite and friendly. We ordered Sushi, Sashimi and Poke bowls (Salmon + Tuna ). Misso soup with crackers and Japanese tea were complimentary, so one can start with soup while they prepare your order fresh. I liked both the soup and tea.

I made a reservation at Minako, which had great reviews, but I had no idea it was the same place from 7 years that changed sushi for me!!!\n\nThe head chef from before has unfortunately passed, but it’s still as good as it’s used to be.\n\nIt’s different from what I remember, more structured to be an experience rather than the sushi master just giving you stuff and jokingly telling you how to eat it.\n\nMust go here on a trip to Stockholm, always. And always take omakase, worth every dime!!!"

If you go for the lunch omakase option (approximately 475kr which is great value), you will receive handcrafted sashimi and sushi at the bar. I found all the dishes really tasty, fresh and varied. The started with cucumber and radish was so simple, yet full of umami flavour and a fantastic start to the experience. The Japanese ice cream desert with roasted sesame seeds was divine.\n\nService & Atmosphere\nThe service is on point, continuously refilling your water, checking up on you and being attentive and polite. The atmosphere is pleasant and relaxing with Japanese music in the background."

Compared to any other sushi restaurant, Sushi Ureshii has the best food presentation, service, and quality fish. Even though the quality is top notch, the service is very speedy, I got my food in under 10 minutes even during rush hour. The name ureshii truly fits the service and evironment! 10/10 recommend!!"

When I arrived to the gym they asked me to pay 99 SEK in order to have some sort of access card to the gym if I want to enter to the gym between 5 a.m to 23 p.m for a whole week or I just come during the week when the receptionist are there ( mainly between 15 to 19 on weekdays).\nIt is ridiculous to ask money for a week free training test period time. If that is the policy it should be mentioned in the time that you register online. Moreover, I downloaded their application to see if I can login via my registered email but it does fail too."

Can’t recommend this place enough, awesome!!  **heads up to non-Swedish citizens**: you must speak with staff in-person to get a day/week pass membership (online registration requires a Swedish SSN), so aim around 11-1500."

For 200kr a month, it can't be beat. I've been to several locations around Stockholm, but this is my 'home gym'.  It's a bit more basic than other locations. The machines are limited, there's only one power rack, one bench, etc. So,  if you come at a busy time, expect to wait for a machine/equipment. The regulars are all quite friendly, and happy to give you a spot if you need one. The equipment here is a bit run down, half the plates seem to be missing chunks of plastic, the kettlebell set is missing some weights. Theres a 'tjejgym' in the back but I have no idea what that looks like.\nIf you're after some cardio machines or basic lifting, it's great."

Large space but low ceiling and lack of air circulation/ natural lighting makes it a bit boxy training inside. The reception area is also really small and a bit dirty. The main training area is clean though. Overall a good gym especially for the price with more equipment/space to others of the chain."

However as small as the space can be, they are able to utilize it very well with every area having just enough space not to feel crowded. I've been to a decent amount of gyms and there was just something about this one that felt comfortable to me. Staff are mostly doing their own thing majority of the time, but are very helpful and friendly if you need any assistance. Restrooms/Lockers are well taken care of, clean, and spacious, and there wasn't a single day that I didn't see the staff cleaning the machines, mopping, or taking good care of the place overall. The front desk has shoe covers for safety and cleaning purposes, as well as the usual goodies such as snacks, protein powders, shakers, straps etc.\n\nOne thing to have in consideration though, I never went to the gym past 8:00 AM since we had plans for the entirety of our days, hence why I would go so early. Having said that, the gym never had more than 10-15 attendants during those hours so it never felt cluttered. Nonetheless I can see how the gym can start to feel crowded at around the 25-30 attendants at the same time.\n\nIf you're in Stockholm I believe it is a great option to get your workouts in!"

Very good trainers, and there is a general nice atmosphere there.\n\nI recommend bringing your own Gloves, because the borrow ones smell like death.\n\nThe facility is in a basement so at times the air can be really musky and feel thick. It’s the only thing that stopped me giving this fantastic gym 5 stars.\n\nIf you want to develop your Muay Thai skills, Odenplan fighting gym is the perfect place for you."

No responsibility was taken. Taking responsibility when you make a mistake can be a simple thing. Don't expect Savant to treat you straight. If problems arise. Not necessarily to be trusted, these individuals. They overcharged for their skills and appeared to apologize when they were clearly wrong. Cost me many thousands in time."
